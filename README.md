# Wine Quality Prediction

#### <ins>Problem Statement</ins>
In this project, we will perform classification on red wine quality. The red wine dataset was developed by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis.  

In this dataset, we have input variables based on physicochemical tests, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, etc. Also, there is an output variable based on sensory data, called quality (score between 0 and 10). We will first transform the output variable into a binary variable, then apply classification on the dataset to see if we can accurately classify the red wine quality. 

#### <ins>Data Source:</ins>
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
